This code defines a method reverseWords that reverses the order of words in a given string s. 
It first splits the string into a list of words using s.split(). Then, it reverses the list with lstr[::-1]. 
Finally, it joins the reversed list back into a single string with words separated by a single space using " ".join(revlst). 
The result is a string where the original words are in the reverse order compared to their initial arrangement.
